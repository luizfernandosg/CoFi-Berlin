Dark Matter Labs in Berlin focuses on building infrastructures for civic renewal and addressing systemic transitions towards a regenerative future founded on care and entanglement. Their work includes creating whole city retrofits, civically-maintained urban forests, self-sovereign housing, and playful cities.

Established in 2016, Dark Matter Labs collaborates with institutions to reimagine and redesign civic goods governance and multi-capital world recognition. Their portfolio spans place-based civic infrastructures, transition cities networks, deep code innovations, investor networks, and governance innovation, targeting urban tree canopies, neighbourhood retrofit, mental health, and soil restoration.
