## [[1. Project Overview]]

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic knowledge base and ecosystem map showcasing the vibrant communities part of Moos' and Berlin's value-aligned ecosystems. This initiative aims to facilitate real connections and collaborations by providing a comprehensive overview of:

- **[[Moos]] Ecosystem:** Featuring 12 projects/communities/entries.
- **[[Berlin Ecosystem]]:** Encompassing more than 60 projects/communities/entries.

## [[2. Aligning with Hackathon Pillars]]

This project is aligned with the three pillars of Doing, Knowing, and Being, by:

- **Doing:** Mapping the diverse ecosystem of Moos and Berlin into an expansive knowledge base to guide community engagement.
- **Knowing:** Enhancing the initiation process through the collected wisdom, fostering meaningful connections.
- **Being:** Utilizing AI agents like Loob as personalized gateways for deeper interaction with the ecosystems.

## [[3. Design]]

The knowledge base is designed with the following components:

- **Backend:** A GitHub repository containing Markdown files as knowledge entries. [View Repo](https://github.com/luizfernandosg/CoFi-Berlin)
- **Frontend:** The knowledge base is published online using Obsidian Publish. [View Knowledge Base](https://publish.obsidian.md/moos-ecosystem-map/Moos+Knowledge+Base)
- **Integrations:** Collaborating with other Hackathon groups for data ingestion and visualization. This includes:
    - David's Obsidian Node Canvas for web scraping and AI/LLM integration.
    - Anton's Moos Community Map for visualizing the ecosystem and gamifying interactions.

## [[4. Future Integrations and Developments - Loob]]

Plans include integrating the knowledge base with Loob to serve as a personal agent and interface for accessing and contributing to Moos' collective knowledge.

## [[5. Future Integrations and Developments - CoFi Credit Clearing Tools]]

Integration with CoFi credit clearing tools like Local Loop by Mutual Credit Services is planned to track financial interactions within the Berlin project network, aiming to bolster community resilience and optimize liquidity.

## [[6. Envisioning the Impact]]

This project aims to elevate visibility for community initiatives, foster a network of collaboration among aligned projects, and support the growth of Moos and the Berlin ecosystem in movements like CoFi and ReFi.

## [[7. Future Vision]]

The future vision includes developing a network of interoperable knowledge bases and hosting a follow-up hackathon using Moos credits to further cultivate developments and foster deeper integration within the Berlin ecosystem.
