## [[1. Project Overview]]

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic knowledge base and ecosystem map showcasing the vibrant communities part of Moos' and Berlin's value-aligned ecosystems. This initiative aims to facilitate real connections and collaborations by providing a comprehensive overview of:

- **[[Moos]] Ecosystem:** Featuring 12 projects/communities/entries.
- **[[Berlin Ecosystem]]:** Encompassing more than 60 projects/communities/entries.

## [[2. Aligning with Hackathon Pillars]]

This project is aligned with the three pillars of Doing, Knowing, and Being, by:
- **Doing:** Mapping the diverse ecosystem of Moos and Berlin into an expansive knowledge base to guide community engagement.
- **Knowing:** Enhancing the initiation process through the collected wisdom, fostering meaningful connections.
- **Being:** Utilizing AI agents like Loob as personalized gateways for deeper interaction with the ecosystems.

## [[3. Design]]

The knowledge base is designed with the following components:
- **Backend:**
	- GitHub Repo with Markdown files with metadata as knowledge entries - https://github.com/luizfernandosg/CoFi-Berlin
- **Frontend:**
	- Knowledge base published online using Obsidian Publish - https://publish.obsidian.md/moos-ecosystem-map/Moos+Knowledge+Base
- **Integrations with other Hackathon groups:**
	- **David's Obsidian Node Canvas**: integrating advanced web scraping and AI/LLM to ingest data from and to the knowledge base, integrating with Anton's community map - https://github.com/Davidiusdadi/obsidian-node-canvas
	- **Anton's Moos Community Map**: map visualization of Moos' and Berlin's ecosystem of projects, with data coming from the knowledge base through David's integration, that allows for gamifying relations and engagements within the ecosystem - https://moos-map.de/

## [[4. Future Integrations and Developments - Loob]]

Integrate the knowledge base with Loob for it to be a personal agent and interface for Moos collective knowledge:
- To have the knowledge base as knowledge repository, to expose and answer questions about Moos and its network of projects in Berlin, promoting curiosity and intentional exploration and engagement
- To facilitate the collection of new insights through interactive chats, inviting users to contribute their experiences and knowledge, enriching the ecosystem's wisdom

## [[5. Future Integrations and Developments - CoFi Credit Clearing Tools]]

- **CoFi Tools Integration**: Plans to incorporate CoFi (Collaborative Finance) credit clearing tools, like [Local Loop by Mutual Credit Services](https://www.loom.com/share/fac64fc7d8534d78bfeb412e05b8859b?sid=6021a7fa-8d3d-4078-89cb-1098df87852a), to track and promote financial interactions within the Berlin project network.
	- With a map of the of interconnected projects in Berlin, it can be used as a base to track financial interactions
- **Financial Resilience and Optimization**: This integration aims to bolster community resilience by reducing dependency on external capital, optimizing liquidity, and fostering mutual support through credit issuance.

## [[6. Envisioning the Impact]]

- Elevates visibility for diverse community initiatives.
- Fosters a network of collaboration among aligned projects.
- Supports the growth of Moos as a vibrant, active community node in the Berlin ecosystem and in movements like CoFi and ReFi .

## [[7. Future Vision]]

- **Interoperable Knowledge Networks**: Ambitious plans to develop a network of interoperable knowledge bases, using platforms like Murmurations for wider community engagement.
- **Follow-Up Hackathon**: Aiming to utilize Moos credits - from a possible prize - to host a subsequent hackathon, further cultivating developments and fostering deeper integration within the Berlin ecosystem.
