- **Lists**: Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) or numbered lists for organized, easy-to-follow content.
- **Emphasis**: Use bold (`**bold**`) and italics (`*italics*`) to highlight key points or terms.
- **Images**: Insert images where relevant using `![alt text](image URL)`. Consider the placement and size for readability.
