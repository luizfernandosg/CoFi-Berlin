_On the border of Berlin‚Äôs historic Treptower Park, something beautiful is growing..._

_In an old bathtub factory you can find intentional communities, sustainable startups, activist organisations‚Ä¶_

**The Moos Community is a Berlin incubator for regenerative economic concepts, space-making, community building, creative practices and paradigm shifting projects, that speak to a hopeful future.

We welcome artists, technologists, entrepreneurs, community weavers, mystics, thinkers and doers from around the world for 1-3 month visits during which time they help build our community, collaborate within the meaning economy and pursue what is calling them.**

# About Moos

## Values

On the border of Berlin‚Äôs historic Treptower Park stands a significant building: Moos. This edifice once housed the Moosdorf & Hochh√§usler factory, renowned for producing the world's first rocking bathtub.

Today, the storied Moos building has transformed into a vibrant hub, home to a diverse range of communities, businesses, and initiatives. While each project maintains its distinct legal structure, team, and set of activities, they coexist in harmony. These multifaceted groups come together to shape a "community of communities", mutually supporting one another and ensuring the venue remains spirited and alive.

Now, we wish to pen a new chapter in this building's illustrious history. After hosting various short-term co-living experiments with people from around the world residing in Moos, we are transitioning to a long-term co-living experience. Allow us to share more about this exciting venture.

# Who is Moos seeking?

## Organisers, Community-Builders and Creatives

Moos garden invites artists and community-builders from around the world to Berlin for short visits from a few weeks up to 3 months, to engage with our extended community and develop new frameworks for:

- üë•¬† Self organisation, community **manifestation** and effective collaborative environments.
- üé®¬† Collaborative, participatory and transcendental **art**.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è¬† Practices for **collective** living, self organisation, radical new culture, and emotional expression.
    - ‚≠ï¬† Alternative currencies, regenerative token systems, and sacred **economies.**
    - üñº¬† Collective visioning of symbiotic space-making and hubs of sovereign community.
- üå± Reciprocity, tending and care for relationships, systems, stories and ecologists.

## How we currently create at [[Moos Garden]].

- We pursue self organised, high agency collaborations.
    - In light of ideal governance, we take responsibility and action where we see need or possibility. Upholding standards of open communication and an advice process with whoever may be affected in our actions but moving forward where we see need.
    - If we see something that needs doing, we ask if not me, then who? If we need help, or context, or resources, we ask it, if we do not get we make what we can.
    - We seek input from those holding responsibility, listen attentively to perspectives, objections and nuance. Always starting from a place of trust, and always seeking synthesis and reconciliation in opposition.
- We seek transparency of static and dynamic hierarchies, and are willing to step up with humility to the centre if something calls us.
    - We will always find information asymmetry, and with it the contentious game of power. Yet we recognise the struggle in it‚Äôs necessity for meaningful change, and seek it‚Äôs dissolution as an obstacle and the clinging of control through our openness, mutual positive regard, and faith in the intention of our collaborators. We are all crew, we are team human.
    - We hold empathy for those at the centre of communication in complex systems, and recognise the veil of ignorance we hold from the outside. Compounding expectations and responsibility create strain, and when we see it in others we do our best to relieve.
- We seek practical solutions from deep alignment, momentum toward unity, and cultivating mystery in our complexity.
    - We aim to act from a place of clarity in how we see things together. Always from a place of care, an assumption of trust, and recognition of self in the other.
    - We pay attention to the process and the flow from initiation, and steward it to ever more reciprocity, balance and coherence.
    - In curiosity and darkness, we play with what can be, rooted in surprise and humility, yet holding a confidence under playfulness and fiction.
- We show deep gratitude, in the recognition of significance and contribution.
    - We seek to make visible the respect and admiration shared among us for those bringing about visions in our community. We are stewards of stories started before us. We hope to be always striving for accuracy and beauty, in how we tell this story of our evolution. Both in moos, and as a wider movement of change.

# How you can help

## Support

Offer your skills or support to the core team and become involved in this new phase of Moos Garden.

## [[Circles UBI]]

Circles is one of the projects stewarded by Moos for experimenting our way to a solidarity economy. **[Circles](https://joincircles.net/)** is a UBI (universal basic income) to see what happens when a community accepts and offers services and goods with Circles. There is no formal way to change circles to Euros so it creates a tight micro-economy.

Support Circles [here](https://joincircles.net/donate/)

## Household items

We would be very glad for donations of housewares, furniture, art and decorations from those in the Berlin community.
