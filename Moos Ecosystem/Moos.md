**The Moos Community is a Berlin incubator for regenerative economic concepts, space-making, community building, creative practices and paradigm shifting projects, that speak to a hopeful future.

On the border of Berlin’s historic Treptower Park stands a significant building: Moos. This edifice once housed the Moosdorf & Hochhäusler factory, renowned for producing the world's first rocking bathtub.

Today, the storied Moos building has transformed into a vibrant hub, home to a diverse range of communities, businesses, and initiatives. While each project maintains its distinct legal structure, team, and set of activities, they coexist in harmony. These multifaceted groups come together to shape a "community of communities", mutually supporting one another and ensuring the venue remains spirited and alive.
