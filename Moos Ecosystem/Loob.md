Loob Labs, a [[Seks]] initiative, introduces a groundbreaking approach to collective storytelling and memory preservation through a generative AI-powered conversational AI platform. This innovative project seeks to enrich shared spaces—like nightclubs, temples, and homes—with "narrative lubrication," enhancing our ability to remember and connect over common experiences. At its core, Loob Labs leverages advanced technology to reimagine journaling, addressing the "meaning crisis" by fostering a community-oriented platform for sharing, reflecting, and visualizing individual and collective journeys, especially in urban environments grappling with psychedelic experience integration.

The platform, named Loob, employs retrieval augmented generation and cross-LLM integration, revolutionizing how event organizers collect anonymized feedback, providing them with actionable insights. Simultaneously, it gamifies and ritualizes the experience for users, aiding in the integration of their experiences. Loob Labs champions "commugenesis," disputing the notion that healing is an individual endeavor, and instead, promoting a shared healing journey. By creating a trustworthy, decentralized infrastructure that prioritizes communal analog experiences in our digital era, Loob Labs aspires to shift towards a global approach to stress and data deprivatization, inviting users to join their mission in transforming collective memory and experience.
