Regens Unite is a community and a commons, emphasizing a rejection of the "growth at all costs" mindset to form a resilient movement dedicated to regeneration. It's structured as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), aiming to connect individuals and projects across various sectors with a common goal of creating regenerative solutions for communities and the environment. Regens Unite encourages the formation of local chapters to leverage collective learnings and support the design of regenerative events within different locales. Their focus extends to building a global network of partners, including Blockchain for Good, Decentralized Desires, and Extinction Rebellion, among others, to promote regenerative practices, digital innovation for sustainable development, and non-violent direct action for climate and ecological emergency.

**Regens Unite Berlin 2023**: An event that bridges regenerative communities across diverse fields such as DAOs, ReFi, DeSci, Platform Coops, and more. It aims to co-create and share projects, knowledge, and hope, emphasizing diversity and resilience. 
Moos is highlighted as the ideal venue for this gathering, underscoring its role in fostering creative and community-focused initiatives.
