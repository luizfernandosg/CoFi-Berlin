The Hologram is a pioneering project focused on peer-to-peer (P2P) healthcare, functioning as a viral, mythoreal distribution system for non-expert healthcare. It fosters mutualistic support and solidarity towards a post-capitalist future where peer cooperation is essential. The core of The Hologram's approach involves small groups facilitating personal transformations through a P2P healthcare system, aiming for its viral spread across various social and geographical contexts.

**Key Initiatives and Innovations:**

- **Courses and LARP:** The Hologram has hosted a series of courses, including "We must begin again: Asking for help as a new world," inviting global participation to practice mutual aid and solidarity. A notable extension of this educational approach is the use of Live Action Role-Play (LARP) to envision and plan for post-pandemic futures.
  
- **Community of Practice and Workbook:** The Hologram supports a growing community of practice, with monthly meetings and "Minimum Viable Holograms (MVH)" sessions to guide newcomers through the project's principles and practices. A workbook titled "The Hologram: Feminist, Peer-to-Peer Health for a Post Pandemic Future" serves as a starter kit, offering insights into initiating Hologram groups.

- **The Hologram Film:** Directed by Cassie Thornton, this film showcases the practice and philosophy of The Hologram, modeling its protocol both online and offline. The film is part of The Hologram's efforts to illustrate the potential of creating an expansive network of contributors who are healthy and stable enough to thrive beyond the end of capitalism.
