The Church of Interbeing engages in community rituals aiming to reconnect individuals with life through meditation, singing, movement, and dialogue. These gatherings occur weekly, fostering an environment of inquiry, intention, and community. The rituals are hosted in Genezareth Kirche, Berlin, and other locations across Europe and the world, primarily on Sundays from 13:00 to 14:30. The core philosophy revolves around the belief that humans thrive on story, ritual, and community, emphasizing the importance of connection to enhance care for oneself, others, and the surrounding life.

Additionally, the Church of Interbeing has organized retreats, such as the Work That Reconnects Retreat, which is based on principles aimed at fostering a deeper connection with the natural world, oneself, and the community. This retreat involves activities like playful, embodied moments, meditation, song, and space for personal sharing towards working for the Great Turning. The event emphasizes outdoor living, communal food preparation in an outdoor kitchen, and various exercises designed to deepen relationships with the natural environment.
