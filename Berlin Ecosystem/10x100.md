10x100 is a comprehensive learning-centered framework designed to prompt organizational changes leading from commitment to actionable impacts throughout the entire value chain. It focuses on creating new markets, legislative adjustments, and coordinated efforts for significant advancements. With a foundation in the next crucial 10x100 days, it offers a unique window of opportunity for transformative changes in human activities through designed, rather than disastrous, shifts. This period is deemed critical for adjusting policies to effectively respond to the current polycrisis and for leveraging practices that support mutual advancements towards a regenerative future. The initiative is backed by collaborations with entities like Politics for Tomorrow, [[Dark Matter Labs]], and the Center for Complexity, RISD, showcasing a multidisciplinary approach to systemic shifts through events and labs.

10x100 also introduces a set of tools and services under the X*C protocol, which facilitates collaborative foresight, reflection, and significant priority shifts to address strategic gaps. This is achieved by combining responses to short-term crises with long-term systemic change efforts. X*C's methodology is built around asking reflective questions for personal and collective growth, relying on text-based sense-making and pattern recognition for systematic analysis, identifying leverage points, and coordinating systemic interventions. The ultimate goal is to use technology to enhance collaborative coordination within a learning system, thereby fostering participatory leadership and accelerating the self-coordination of multi-actor alliances.
