Circles UBI (Universal Basic Income) in Berlin represents a pioneering project aimed at establishing an alternative currency system. This system is designed to provide a basic income to its participants, promoting a more equitable and decentralized economic model. Circles UBI leverages blockchain technology to enable the distribution of a digital currency called Circles (CRC), which users receive on a regular basis without the prerequisites typically associated with traditional financial systems.

### Overview of Circles UBI

Circles UBI was initiated to explore the possibilities of a community-driven basic income system, utilizing blockchain's decentralization principles to create a more inclusive and equitable economic model. It is designed as a form of electronic money issued on a periodic basis to individuals, facilitating transactions within a trust-based network. The project underscores the value of mutual support and solidarity, aiming to build social and technical infrastructures for value distribution where the community decides on the importance of life aspects.

### Key Features and Developments

- **Trust-Based Network**: Circles operates on a trust-based system where transactions occur between trusted parties. This model underscores the project's emphasis on community and mutual support.
- **Global Outreach**: Circles UBI aims for global accessibility, extending its reach beyond Berlin to include communities worldwide as an act of unconditional solidarity. Efforts include developing tools and plans to support Circles' global adoption.
- **Marketplace and Wallet**: A marketplace for buying and selling goods and services in Berlin using Circles has been established, along with a wallet that supports CRC and potentially other currencies to facilitate transactions.
- **Community Involvement and Events**: Circles UBI has engaged in various community events and crowdfunding campaigns to support its development and promote the idea of basic income. This includes participation in international assemblies and local events like the Basic Income March.

### Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its innovative approach and community support, Circles UBI faced challenges, leading to an announcement in early 2024 about the cessation of Circles Coop's operations due to financial limitations. However, the wallet, user support, and marketplace remain operational as the project explores future directions. The system uses Gnosis Chain and operates on a trust-based network where users issue and receive a cryptocurrency known as Circles (CRC).

### Related Projects and Collaborations

Several projects and businesses have collaborated with Circles UBI, contributing to a broader ecosystem of sustainable and community-focused initiatives in Berlin. These include:

Circles UBI represents a bold experiment in reimagining economic systems to be more inclusive, equitable, and community-oriented. Despite facing challenges, the project's foundational ideas and the ecosystem it has inspired continue to influence discussions around alternative currencies and basic income models.
