The Embassy Network is a collective of place-based communities focused on experimenting with new forms of governance and solidarity. It offers a global network of coliving spaces, embodying principles of sharing, collaboration, and connectivity. These spaces are designed to support creative thinkers and practical visionaries exploring innovative social systems. Membership in the Embassy Network provides access to comfortable, engaged communities worldwide, aimed at individuals looking to immerse themselves in dynamic environments rich in events, discussions, and projects.

Locations within the Embassy Network are diverse and independently run, each with its unique approach to creating a community. These spaces often blend short-term and long-term accommodations, emphasizing common areas to facilitate interaction and collaboration. Financial contributions from guests support hosting operations, community activities, and the upkeep of the spaces.

The platform not only facilitates guest hosting and event management but also serves as a hub for a global community of nomads, travelers, and locals seeking deeper connections and shared experiences. With an open-source platform, the Embassy Network encourages the addition of new locations, providing tools for managing bookings, payments, and event schedules, all designed to foster community engagement.
