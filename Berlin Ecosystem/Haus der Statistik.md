Haus der Statistik is a pioneering urban development project located at Alexanderplatz, Berlin. This former GDR office complex, once slated for demolition, has been transformed into a model of community-oriented development. Since its vacancy over a decade ago, it has evolved into a vibrant hub for culture, social activities, education, affordable housing, and administrative functions, including a new town hall for Mitte.

**Key Initiatives and Collaborations:**

- **Initiative Haus der Statistik:** Formed after a public demonstration in 2015, this initiative brought together a wide array of Berliners from various sectors including social and cultural institutions, artist collectives, architects, and more. This group played a crucial role in saving the building from demolition and reconceptualizing it as a space for cultural, educational, and social use.
  
- **ZUsammenKUNFT Berlin eG (ZKB):** Emerged from the initiative, ZKB is a cooperative focused on urban development, which has become a legal entity collaborating with potential partners to further the development of Haus der Statistik. ZKB forms part of the "Koop5" – a coalition alongside the Senate Department for Urban Development and Housing, the district office of Mitte, WBM (Wohnungsbaugesellschaft Berlin-Mitte), and BIM (Berliner Immobilienmanagement).

- **[[Koop5]]:** A collaborative force comprising ZKB, government bodies, and state-owned companies, working towards the common good. This partnership reflects a novel and effective model of urban development, ensuring the project aligns with community interests and contributes positively to the surrounding area.

Haus der Statistik stands as a landmark project within Berlin's collaborative finance ecosystem, showcasing how cooperative models and community involvement can lead to sustainable urban development. It represents a shift away from traditional commercial redevelopment projects towards a model that prioritizes social, cultural, and educational values alongside affordable living spaces.

This project underscores the potential of collaborative finance and urban development practices to create spaces that serve the common good, foster community engagement, and promote inclusivity. By involving a diverse group of stakeholders in its development, Haus der Statistik serves as an inspiring example of how urban spaces can be reimagined and revitalized to meet the needs of the community.
