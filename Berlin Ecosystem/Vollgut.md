The Vollgut in Berlin represents an innovative and resource-positive approach to construction and community engagement in urban spaces. Situated in Berlin Neukölln, this project, realized by the Natural Building Lab at the Technical University of Berlin, serves as a hub for collaboration and information about the ongoing activities on the Vollgut site. 

The construction utilizes circular principles, featuring a roof structure made from reused timber beams and walls from upcycled cardboard boxes and advertising posters. This approach not only addresses urban resource management but also fosters community development by serving as a collective space for various actors active on the site.

The Vollgut area is a dynamic and evolving project, about half utilized while the other half awaits development. Despite challenges such as the lack of basic infrastructure in the unused sections, the site is a refuge for urban actors displaced from other parts of the city. Efforts to renovate and make the building fully accessible involve cooperation with TRNSFRM eG and aim at ecological sustainability, economic affordability, and social solidarity.

The Vollgut project in Berlin connects with [[Moos]] through [[Cohere]], a network focusing on social impact and community building. Cohere offers a coliving experience at Moos, aiming to amplify the impact of changemakers. This initiative reflects a commitment to collaborative and sustainable urban development.
