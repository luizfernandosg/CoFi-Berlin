The DisCO (Distributed Cooperative Organization) model is a radical approach for organizations that aim to create and share value in cooperative, commons-oriented, and feminist-economic ways. It is designed as a friendly and carefully planned system for radical workplace democracy. The model encompasses various facets of organizational operation, including value transfers, access privilege mediated transfers, and conversion of credits among other financial operations.

DisCO emphasizes the use of modular components and Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) tools within what is known as the DisCO Stack. This toolkit is designed to support collaborative work using the DisCO Methodology, including tools for time tracking, communication, task management, collaborative writing, file storage, and more. The aim is to leverage existing FLOSS tools into a complementary framework custom-designed for DisCO's needs and value accounting.

The DisCO model extends into real-world applications through DisCO LABS, which are pilot projects that apply and develop the DisCO governance model in diverse contexts. These LABS are integral to the participatory action research aspect of DisCO, reflecting a diversity of geographical and cultural contexts with various mission-oriented productive works. Furthermore, the DisCO Project involves research lines developed through collaborations with universities and research collectives on participatory action research, as well as investigations into applying the DisCO methodology to research itself.

In summary, DisCO represents a comprehensive framework for creating distributed, cooperative organizations that prioritize communal value, inclusive governance, and feminist economic principles.
