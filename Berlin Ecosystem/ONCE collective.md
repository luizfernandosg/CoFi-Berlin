ONCE Collective presents itself as a community dedicated to reviving collective imagination through a network of purpose-driven creatives, thinkers, and strategists. They emphasize media-driven alignment, inspiring collaborative futures, and are involved in transcending individual and collective human experiences. This is achieved by leveraging technology, possibly blockchain, to foster "skin in the game" collaborations, promoting ownership of work rather than merely trading time for equity or cash. Additionally, there's mention of a residency and festival focusing on world-building at the intersection of creativity, technology, and spirit, aiming to expand the boundaries of imagination.
