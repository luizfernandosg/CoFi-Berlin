SuperCoop Berlin, located in Wedding, is a cooperative, community-owned, and member-managed food market. Members of the cooperative contribute by working 3 hours per month, helping to shape the food market through a democratic voting system. Only a handful of employees handle orders and coordination, keeping the focus on community involvement and sustainability.

**How It Works:**
To join SuperCoop, individuals purchase a share for €100 plus a €10 entrance fee. This model ensures that every member has a say in the operation of the supermarket, as they are entitled to one vote at the Plenum meeting, regardless of the number of shares owned. Members also commit to working 3 hours every 4 weeks at the supermarket. This cooperative effort helps to reduce overall costs, making products more affordable for everyone.

**Innovation and Expansion:**
SuperCoop was inspired by the success of similar initiatives around the world, such as New York's Park Slope Food Coop. Since its inception, SuperCoop has grown significantly, starting from a few individuals in 2018 to over 600 members by its opening in September 2021. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign that raised over €70,000, they signed a lease, renovated their space, and opened their doors to the public. Currently, the cooperative has around 1,000 members and is exploring expansion options, including leasing more space and setting up delivery systems with pick-up stations in other districts.

**Community Impact and Learning:**
One of the main challenges faced by SuperCoop was finding a location, members, and financing simultaneously. The community's strength and shared vision were crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The project emphasizes participation, transparency, and sustainable consumption, aiming to foster a bottom-up transformation of the food system.

**Related Projects and Future Directions:**
SuperCoop is part of a larger movement of cooperative supermarkets aimed at socially just transformation of our food system. Similar initiatives are being explored in cities like Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, Osnabrück, and Vienna. This growing network reflects a significant interest in models that prioritize community ownership, sustainable practices, and fair trade.
