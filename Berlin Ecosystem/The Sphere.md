The Sphere is innovating funding for performing arts by enabling collective investment and co-ownership among audiences, artists, and other stakeholders, started by [[Curve Labs]]. It seeks to intertwine artistic processes with funding practices through blockchain technology, focusing initially on the contemporary circus scene. The project encompasses the creation of a dynamic artistic archive and implements smart contracts for rights management, aiming to explore new modes of funding in the arts.
