The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is a revolutionary blockchain innovation aimed at extending the functionality of the internet, allowing for decentralized applications (dApps) to run directly on the web without relying on traditional servers or cloud services. This protocol facilitates a novel approach to software development and deployment, emphasizing security, speed, and scalability. It aims to address the limitations of current blockchain technologies and centralization of the internet, promoting a more open, user-controlled online environment.
